# Storage-site
Alternative google drive to self host, host for family and friends or host for a small group of friends.

If you are using you probably want to set this up in a virtual env or docker.

after setting up virtual env, and installing all the libraries needed run "python server.py" in terminal/cmd

(Eventually I will make a batch script to just easily install and run along with a more in depth setup)
